##Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Digital Forensics

Digital Forensics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence from computers, mobile devices, or networks to investigate cybercrimes or security incidents. The code you've shared is a basic Digital Forensics Tool that combines two functionalities:

Face Detection – using OpenCV.

File Signature (MIME Type) Detection – using the magic library to determine the true type of an image file.

✅ Real-World Example / Use Case Application Name: "Digital Evidence Validator" Scenario: Law enforcement or forensic analysts need to validate and process digital images collected from devices (e.g., phones, computers) during a cybercrime investigation.

Real-World Example: A digital forensics investigator uploads an image recovered from a suspect’s device. This tool:

Confirms the true file type to check for tampering (e.g., verifying that a .jpg file isn't actually something else).

Automatically detects and counts the number of faces in the image, which may help determine:

Whether a person of interest appears in the photo.

If the photo is staged or edited.

This tool could serve as an early-stage filter in a pipeline before more advanced analysis like facial recognition, object detection, or deepfake identification.

✅ 1. Prerequisites Python Installation: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. During installation, select the option to "Add Python to PATH".

✅ 2. Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip: "pip install opencv-python pillow python-magic" NOTE: On Windows, you might need to install python-magic-bin instead of python magic.

✅ 3. Running the Application Windows: Double-click the script file or run it via Command Prompt Linux/Mac: Use the terminal

✅ 4. Understanding the Output

File Signature Info: Displays the MIME type and detailed information about the uploaded image file, helping verify its authenticity.

Face Detection Result: Indicates the number of faces detected in the image, assisting in identifying potential subjects.

✅ 5. Enhancements and Further Development To expand the capabilities of this tool: Deepfake Detection: Integrate deep learning models to identify AI-generated or manipulated images. Facial Recognition: Implement facial recognition to match detected faces against known databases. Metadata Analysis: Extract and analyze EXIF data from images to gather additional forensic information. Report Generation: Automate the creation of detailed reports summarizing the findings for each analyzed image.
